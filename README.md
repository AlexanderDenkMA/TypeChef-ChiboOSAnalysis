## Setup for TypeChef analysis of ChibiOS

Initial setup files with extracted file list and 
features.

Runs through most files, but some test files require stricter
presence conditions.

Requires more setup to really test HAL with multiple possible
target directories

most files contain roughly 30 features, can be analyzed in about two seconds
